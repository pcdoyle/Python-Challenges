# Notes:
## 2-EvenFibonacciNumbers.py:
* I overthought this when I used a list to store the Fibonacci Numbers and instead could have just used two variables. 
* I still like the way I did it as it stores the entire sequence it calculates into the list.
## 6-SumSquareDifference.v1.py / 6-SumSquareDifference.v2.py:
* Version 1 uses a loop, which is not efficient for large numbers.
* Version 2 uses algebra, which is way more efficient.
