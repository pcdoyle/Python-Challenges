## DayOfWeek.Zeller.py:
Get the day of the week from a date entered:
* I wound up working on this a lot more than I expected to, and making it more complicated that it needed to be to try out some different things.
* The important part of this program is the actual "calculateDate()" function that does the equation for Zeller's congruence.
* I might come back to this to caculate leap years and check to see if the month and day are valid inputs (EX: People can't enter month 30).
