# What these are:
These are all programs I have created as part of various programming challenges around the internet. I am just doing this to get the hang of programming again. All projects are done in Python 3.

***Disclaimer:*** These are not the best ways you can solve these problems. These are ways in which I solved them without relying on anything outside of Python documentation. You will find much better solutions for many of these problems elsewhere.

I have also found that I made better solutions to certain problems after needing to do similar problems a second. This is beacuse after I solved a problem, I looked up other ways people solved the problems.
