# What these are:
These are all programs I have created as part of various programming challenges around the internet. I am just doing this to get the hang of programming again. All projects are done in Python 3.

***Disclaimer:*** These are not the best ways you can solve the problems, these are the ways I solved them without looking up anything outside of Python documentation. You will find much better solutions elsewhere.
